Course Overview
---------------

14.462 is the second semester of the second-year Ph.D. macroeconomics sequence.

The course is intended to introduce the students, not only to particular areas of current research, but also to some very useful analytical tools. It covers a selection of topics that varies from year to year. Recent topics include:

*   Growth and Fluctuations
*   Heterogeneity and Incomplete Markets
*   Optimal Fiscal Policy
*   Time Inconsistency
*   Reputation
*   Coordination Games and Macroeconomic Complementarities
*   Information

This year (2004) the course consists of two parts. The first, with Gilles Saint-Paul, concentrates on growth; the second, with George-Marios Angeletos, concentrates on coordination and incomplete markets. The course grade will be based on class participation, 6 or 7 problem sets to be assigned during the course, a midterm at the end of the first half-semester, and the general exam at the end of the semester.
